"Dietrich Bonhoeffer::A God who let us prove his existence would be an idol.",
"Dietrich Bonhoeffer::The fact that the stupid person is often stubborn must not blind us to the fact that he is not independent. In conversation with him, one virtually feels that one is dealing not at all with him as a person, but with slogans, catchwords, and the like that have taken possession of him. He is under a spell, blinded, misused, and abused in his very being. Having thus become a mindless tool, the stupid person will also be capable of any evil and at the same time incapable of seeing that it is evil.",
"Dietrich Bonhoeffer::Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one's prejudgment simply need not be believed&mdash;in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical&mdash;and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack.",
"Abraham Flexner::We make ourselves no promises, but we cherish the hope that the unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge will prove to have consequences in the future as in the past.  Not for a moment, however, do we defend the Institute on that ground.  It exists as a paradise for scholars who, like poets and musicians, have won the right to do as they please and who accomplish most when enabled to do so.",
"H.L. Mencken::As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.",
"John Mayer::Everybody's just a stranger,\nBut that's the danger\nIn going my own way.\nI guess it's the price I'll have to pay.",

"Douglas Adams::One of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.  To summarize: it is a well known fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.  To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.",
"Lao Tzu::Losing the way of life, men rely on goodness.  Losing goodness, they rely on laws.",
"Stephen King::We had a chance to change the world but opted for the Home Shopping Network instead.",
"Isaac Asimov::If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.",
"Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding::Some birds arenâ€™t meant to be caged; their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice, but, still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyâ€™re gone. I guess I just miss my friend.",
"Russell Crowe as John Nash::Like a diet of the mind, I choose not to indulge certain appetites.  Like my appetite for patterns.  Perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream.",
"Jordan Peterson::People get unbelievably upset when you poke them in the axioms.",
"Alan Kay::A change in perspective is worth 80 IQ points.",
"Frank Herbert \"Bene Gesserit Litany Against Fear\"::I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.",

"unknown::The weak use rules to bind the strong.",
"Charles Bukowski::Find what you love and let it kill you.",
"Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar::I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story.  ...  I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.",
"Charles Bukowski::You have to die a few times before you can really live.",
"Mark Forsyth::...adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun.  So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife.  But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you'll sound like a maniac.  It's an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out.  And as size comes before colour, green great dragons can't exist.",
"Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh::If the rule you followed brought you to this: of what use what the rule?",
"George Bernard Shaw::Those who talk most about the blessings of marriage and the constancy of its vows are the very people who declare that if the chain were broken and the prisoners left free to choose, the whole social fabric would fly asunder.  You cannot have the argument both ways.  If the prisoner is happy, why lock him in?  If he is not, why pretend that he is?",
"Bob Marley::You may not be her first, her last, or her only.  She loved before; she may love again; but if she loves you now, what else matters?  She's not perfect&mdash;you aren't either&mdash;and the two of you may never be perfect together, but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can.  She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break: her heart.  So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give.  Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.",
"Steve Eisman::They mistook leverage for genius.",
"George Orwell::If people cannot write well, they cannot think well. And if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them.",
"Zach Weinersmith::Using neural networks to fool the human mind is like using a bazooka to fight a hamster.",
"David McCullough::Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard.",
"Carl Sagan::I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time -- when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness...The dumbing down of American is most evident in the slow decay of substantive content in the enormously influential media, the 30 second sound bites (now down to 10 seconds or less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations on pseudoscience and superstition, but especially a kind of celebration of ignorance."
