"Ayn Rand::We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force.",
"Ayn Rand::When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion - when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing - when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors - when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don't protect you against them, but protect them against you - when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice - you may know that your society is doomed.",

Gone forever,\nlike the girls I never kissed,\nand the places I never visited —\nthe lost lives I never lived.",

"Dietrich Bonhoeffer::A God who let us prove his existence would be an idol.",
"Dietrich Bonhoeffer::The fact that the stupid person is often stubborn must not blind us to the fact that he is not independent. In conversation with him, one virtually feels that one is dealing not at all with him as a person, but with slogans, catchwords, and the like that have taken possession of him. He is under a spell, blinded, misused, and abused in his very being. Having thus become a mindless tool, the stupid person will also be capable of any evil and at the same time incapable of seeing that it is evil.",
"Dietrich Bonhoeffer::Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one's prejudgment simply need not be believed—in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical—and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack.",
"Abraham Flexner::We make ourselves no promises, but we cherish the hope that the unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge will prove to have consequences in the future as in the past.  Not for a moment, however, do we defend the Institute on that ground.  It exists as a paradise for scholars who, like poets and musicians, have won the right to do as they please and who accomplish most when enabled to do so.",
"H.L. Mencken::As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.",
"John Mayer::Everybody's just a stranger,\nBut that's the danger\nIn going my own way.\nI guess it's the price I'll have to pay.",
"Edward R. Murrow::To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; credible we must be truthful.",
"John Oliver::Cryptocurrencies: everything you don't understand about money, combined with everything you don't understand about computers.",
"Dylan Moran::That's the ultimate human shopping list.  'I'd like some illegal, some forbidden, some frowned upon, and some down right disgust, please.'",
"Douglas Adams::One of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.  To summarize: it is a well known fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.  To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.",
"Lao Tzu::Losing the way of life, men rely on goodness.  Losing goodness, they rely on laws.",
"Stephen King::We had a chance to change the world but opted for the Home Shopping Network instead.",
"Isaac Asimov::If knowledge can create problems, it is not through ignorance that we can solve them.",
"Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding::Some birds aren’t meant to be caged; their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice, but, still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they’re gone. I guess I just miss my friend.",
"Russell Crowe as John Nash::Like a diet of the mind, I choose not to indulge certain appetites.  Like my appetite for patterns.  Perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream."
